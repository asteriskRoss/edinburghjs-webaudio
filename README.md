# Introduction to Web Audio for aspiring house music producers

## Description

This is demonstration code to accompany a talk given at the EdinburghJS tech meetup on 19 September 2023.

It demonstrates using the browser Web Audio API to create basic synthesised instruments using oscillators, buffers, ADSR envelopes and filters and then schedule them to play a house music track.

The code is for learning purposes and is not intended to be deployed in a production environment.

## Usage

Copy the HTML and JS files into a directory and serve them using your favourite webserver.

### Example

To use the [Python webserver](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html), assuming you have python installed, run:
`python -m http.server 8080 --bind localhost --directory src`

Then open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
